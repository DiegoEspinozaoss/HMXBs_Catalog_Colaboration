    "1. The reason that the 10 to the 50 power isn't possible for the luminosity is because of the eddington limit? (which consist in the luminosity of a star when its gas pressure overpower the force of gravity?) Do the stars consequently, have a maximum effective temperature?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Wolf-Rayet binary systems are O or B stars (in respect to the companion)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The reason for the difference in the correlation coefficients (spin period-orbital period) in the correlation matrix and Corbet diagram could be due to the fact that the corbet diagram is for all Fortin systems, while in the correlation matrix only the systems that are present in Neumann and Fortin (?) In other words, the coefficient is different because we are taking a subset of systems. Maybe i've introduced some bias in the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. When extrapolating the Spectral type should i take into account the fact that it has spectral class, subclass, luminosity class and aditional characteristics? For example, O8.5Ib-II(f)p where O is the spectral class, 8.5 is the subclass, Ib-II is the luminosity class and f & p are the aditional characteristics. So i have to consider this fact to make the extrapolation in first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Its normal that for example some systems have 0.6 * 10**-12 and others 6.123.123.123.123.123 ergs/s/cm**2 in the XRT_min_flux and XRT_max_flux? That's probably the the reason of why i couln't reproduce Fortin Figure. "
