<h1 align="center">High Mass X-Ray Binaries Catalogs</h1>


Here i use the Data_and_Catalogs_proyect.ipynb file to import the 4 catalogs (Fortin, Neumann actualized and not actualized both of them called cat_neuman_2 and cat_neuman respectively, Malacaria and Kim). 
Also, in the interactive_part_proyect.ipynb file I display all the graphics that require to the user the election of one or more parameters, giving the posibility of selecting the type of Companion (sg, Be, etc)
and the parameters of them, showing the Kendall correlation matrix, the venn diagram, dendograms for positive and negative correlation coefficients, etc. 

Finally, in the non_interactive_part_proyect.ipynb file I add all the graphics that don't require any election by the user (equatorial and galactic distribution of all HMXB's in a like comparation between the 4 catalogs, Corbet diagram, luminosity distribution 
using Swift/BAT fluxes from Neumann and distances from Fortin, the maximum distance for a minimum detectable flux for different luminosities and the distribution of the geometric mean of the min/max Soft Flux columns 
from Neumann catalog).
